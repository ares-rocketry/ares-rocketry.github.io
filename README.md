# ARES Rocketry Website

This is the new static website for ARES Rocketry, designed to be modern, responsive, and lightweight. It matches the visual identity of the University of Melbourne ARES page but is built as a standalone static site for GitHub Pages.

The site will be live at `https://<organization>.github.io/ares-rocketry.github.io/` (or your custom domain).
