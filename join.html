                    <h2>Application Process</h2>
                    <p>
                        ARES holds recruitment rounds at the beginning of each university semester. We announce
                        recruitment
                        via our Instagram page, which is also where you'll be able to find the recruitment form.
                        Recruitment
                        is selective, and follows these basic steps:
                    </p>
                    <ol class="recruitment-steps">
                        <li>Initial submission (including professional CV and short answer responses to questions)</li>
                        <li>Interview for shortlisted applicants (20 - 30 mins)</li>
                        <li>Acceptance for successful candidates!</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Each semester the number of candidates we receive greatly exceeds the number of open positions
                        in
                        the team, which leads us to have to reject many strong candidates. If you're rejected on your
                        first
                        try applying, don't fret! We highly recommend all members to re-apply.
                    </p>

                    </div>

                    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
                    <p>To be an ARES member there are two criteria you must fill:</p>
                    <ul class="eligibility-list">
                        <li>You must be a current student at the University of Melbourne (anywhere from undergraduate to
                            PhD)</li>
                        <li>You must be able to dedicate a sufficient amount of time to ARES work (typically at least 8
                            hours a week)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Many ARES members compare the workload to taking an extra subject at uni, so make sure you're
                        able to commit to that!</p>

                    <h2>Other Ways to Launch Rockets</h2>
                    <p>
                        Are you not eligible to join ARES, but still want to be involved in rocketry? Fret not! Rocketry
                        is
                        a thriving hobby that is accessible to people of all ages from all around the world.

                    <div>
                        <p><strong>University Students (Not at UoM):</strong> Join your own university's rocketry team!
                            Almost all Australian universities have a rocketry team. ARES has close working
                            relationships with the other Victorian teams <a href="https://www.monashhpr.com/"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monash HPR</a> and <a href="https://www.rmithive.com/"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">RMIT HIVE</a>. They both do awesome stuff!</p>

                        <p><strong>Victoria Residents (Non-Students):</strong> Check out the <a
                                href="https://vicra.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victorian Rocketry
                                Association</a>! They are a club that organise and run all hobby rocket launches in
                            Victoria. ARES uses their facilities to conduct our launches, we even have members on the
                            committee! There's instructions on their website about how to get involved, they're a
                            wonderful group of people that ARES would not exist without.</p>

                        <p><strong>Based Elsewhere:</strong> Find your local <a href="https://www.tripoli.org/"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tripoli Rocketry Association</a> prefecture! Chances are
                            you won't be too far from somewhere like the Victorian Rocketry Association, and will be
                            able to get in touch with your local fellow rocketeers there.</p>
