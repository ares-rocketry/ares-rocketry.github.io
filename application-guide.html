                    <p class="intro-text">
                        We're thrilled you're considering joining ARES! As a member, you'll develop high-power sounding
                        rockets that compete internationally, gain hands-on experience with real flight hardware, and
                        build connections in Australia's growing aerospace sector. From operations to propulsion,
                        there's
                        a place for everyone on our team!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to high application volumes, we can only accept a limited number of candidates each
                        semester. This guide will help you stand out and maximize your chances of joining the team.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Application Process</h2>
                    <p>Entry to ARES consists of two stages:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Initial application</strong> – submitted through our online form</li>
                        <li><strong>Interview</strong> – offered to selected applicants</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Before starting, read the sub-team overviews on our <a href="subteams.html">The Team</a> page to
                        understand each group's focus and inform your preferences.</p>

                    <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Application Sections</h2>

                    <h3>Section 1: About You</h3>
                    <p>
                        Basic information about your background and degree. Note that students with limited time
                        remaining at university might be less likely to be offered positions, but this isn't a hard and
                        fast rule.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Section 2: Sub-Team Preferences</h3>
                    <p>
                        Consider both what you're well-suited for and what aligns with your goals and interests. These
                        might differ; balance them as you see fit and explain your reasoning in later sections.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Section 3: Your Application</h3>
                    <p>This is the section you should spend most of your time on!</p>

                    <h4>Relevant Experience</h4>
                    <p>
                        Describe concrete examples of projects you've completed and link them to ARES' work. We value
                        candidates who demonstrate genuine passion and consistently strive to improve their knowledge
                        and skills. If you're applying in the future, consider starting projects now that showcase these
                        qualities.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Skills & Tools</h4>
                    <p>
                        Be honest about your experience with specific tools and processes. We understand many applicants
                        are still learning; this section helps us understand what you know and what we can help you
                        improve on.
                    </p>

                    <h4>What You Know About ARES</h4>
                    <p>
                        We encourage you to go beyond surface-level descriptions. Explore our Instagram and website to
                        understand our history and current activities. Show us you know who we are and what we do, so we
                        can better understand why you want to join.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Why You Want to Join (Very important!)</h4>
                    <p>
                        Tell us what draws you to ARES and what you hope to gain. Think about how you want to grow, what
                        you wish to achieve, and why ARES is the right place for that journey. Really try to convince
                        us!
                    </p>

                    <h4>Time Commitment</h4>
                    <p>
                        Be truthful and realistic. ARES requires significant dedication, with many members comparing it
                        to taking an extra university subject. Consider whether you can reasonably make this commitment
                        before applying.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">CV & Portfolio</h2>
                    <p>
                        Upload a polished, professional CV tailored to your chosen roles. We recommend using online
                        resources and templates to really polish things. Carefully select relevant experience (both what
                        to include and what to remove), and check for spelling and formatting errors. If you have a
                        portfolio of past work, we highly encourage you submit that as well.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Tips for Success</h2>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
                        <li><strong>Use concise, formal language</strong> when responding to application questions. This
                            can be less true in the ‘why do you want to join ARES section’, where you might want to
                            write in your voice for more authenticity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Think carefully about relevance</strong> of the experience you’re highlighting.</li>
                        <li><strong>Let your passion shine!</strong> We particularly love deeply enthusiastic members
                            with a strong desire to contribute to our team. It is important to not just tell us that
                            you’re a passionate person; demonstrate this to us through experiences, values, projects,
                            skills, and aspirations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Don’t fret if you feel your experience isn’t up to scratch!</strong> This is very
                            common, especially for younger applicants. Your application should instead focus on what you
                            aim to achieve in ARES (with specific and researched answers), and what about you will make
                            you a good fit for the team.</li>
                        <li><strong>If you are rejected from the team, don’t stress!</strong> Many strong applicants are
                            rejected their first time around; we highly encourage you to submit again the following
                            semester. During that time, think about what projects you can take on that will strengthen
                            your application for next time! You can always send us an email to ask for guidance on this
                            front.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #856404;">A Note on AI</h3>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                            Whilst ARES does not prohibit the use of generative AI in preparing an application, it tends
                            to harm applications more frequently than it helps them. Candidates who have clearly used AI
                            to write their responses, especially in personal sections such as ‘why do I want to join
                            ARES’ are often seen as lacking authenticity and commitment. Use your discretion in using AI
                            tools to assist with your application; we want to get a sense of who you are. An additional
                            point of note is that using AI to get information on what ARES is typically results in
                            incorrect information being given, ARES has several outdated websites and resources on the
                            internet that AI tools seem to love to collect data from.
